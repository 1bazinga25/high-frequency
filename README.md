# High-frequency intertemporal arbitrage

## Strategy description

Trading target: BTC  

Source of price spread: BTC Perpetual - BTC Quarterly (omit cointegration test)  

Trading period: 1 minute

Position ratio: 1:1  

Trading type: intertemporal arbitrage

Condition of price spread for longing: If there is no position in current account and price spread < (usual price spread - threshold), long the price spread which means long BTC Perpetual and short BTC Quarterly.  

Condition of price spread for shorting: If there is no position in current account and price spread > (usual price spread + threshold), short the price spread which means short BTC Perpetual and long BTC Quarterly.  

Condition of price spread for closing long position: If there is BTC Perpetual long position and BTC Quarterly short position, while price spread > usual price spread, close the long price spread positions, which means short to close the BTC Perpetual position and long to close the BTC Quarterly position.  

Condition of price spread for closing short position: If there is BTC Perpetual short position and BTC Quarterly long position, while price spread < usual price spread, close the short price spread positions, which means long to close the BTC Perpetual position and short to close the BTC Quarterly position.  

e.g.: If the usual price spread between BTC Perpetual and BTC Quarterly is 35. One day, the price spread rises up to 50, we predict the price spread will go back below to 35 in future. Then we could short BTC Perpetual and long BTC Quarterly to short the price spread - vice versa.  

Notice: The price spread between BTC Perpetual and BTC Quarterly will always return around to 0 (maturity date), so when the price spread is positive, short the price spread in priority, and when the price spread is negative, long the price spread in priority.
